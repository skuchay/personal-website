            Age:        52<br>
            Email:      skucekelly@gmail.com<br>

        <p class="paragraph">
            I am a husband, father, son, brother, and friend. I am a geologist, petrophysicist, teacher, mentor, and student.<br>
            My family owns two dogs and loves to work and relax in our backyard. I enjoy comic books (of which I own over 10,000) and pop culture in general.<br>
            I look forward to using these new skills and knowledge to help me share with others my background in visualising and characterising the subsurface of the earth.
